# Backend Security Checklist

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] JWT-based authentication with HttpOnly cookies
- [x] Password hashing with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- [x] Auth middleware protecting sensitive endpoints
- [x] Environment-based JWT secret configuration
- [x] Production environment validation

### Request Security
- [x] Helmet.js for security headers
- [x] Rate limiting (100 req/15min general, 5 req/15min auth)
- [x] Request size limits (10MB)
- [x] CORS configuration with origin validation
- [x] Input validation for required fields
- [x] CSRF protection (production mode)
- [x] Comprehensive input validation with express-validator
- [x] XSS prevention through input sanitization
- [x] SQL injection protection (Prisma ORM + validation)
- [x] Account lockout mechanism (5 failed attempts, 15min lockout)

### Error Handling
- [x] Generic error messages (don't reveal user existence)
- [x] Structured error logging
- [x] Global error handler
- [x] Detailed validation error responses

## üö® Still Need to Implement

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- [x] express-validator for comprehensive input validation
- [x] SQL injection protection (Prisma provides this)
- [x] XSS protection for user-generated content
- [ ] File upload validation (if implemented)

### Additional Security Headers
- [x] CSRF protection tokens
- [x] Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- [x] X-Frame-Options configuration

### Monitoring & Logging
- [x] Failed login attempt monitoring (account lockout system)
- [x] Suspicious activity detection (lockout system)
- [x] Advanced threat detection system
- [x] Real-time injection attack prevention (SQL, XSS, Path Traversal)
- [x] Brute force attack detection and blocking
- [x] Anomalous behavior analysis
- [x] Privilege escalation detection
- [x] IP reputation and blocking system
- [ ] Security event alerting (email/SMS notifications)
- [ ] Request correlation IDs (partially implemented)

### Database Security
- [x] Database connection encryption
- [ ] Database user with minimal privileges
- [ ] Regular backup verification

## üîí Production Deployment Checklist

### Required Environment Variables
- `JWT_SECRET`: Strong random secret (minimum 32 characters)
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL`: Production database connection
- `FRONTEND_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated allowed origins
- `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true`: For HTTPS-only cookies
- `LOG_LEVEL=warn`: Reduce log verbosity in production

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS certificate configured
- [ ] Firewall rules (only necessary ports open)
- [ ] VPN or IP whitelist for admin access
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Database access restricted to application

### Monitoring
- [ ] Uptime monitoring
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Security log monitoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Security Risks

### High Priority
None identified - Core security measures implemented

### Medium Priority
1. **No session management** - JWTs can't be revoked until expiry
2. **No password strength requirements** - Weak passwords allowed (Note: Validation enforces strength but signup doesn't enforce it yet)
3. **No two-factor authentication** - Single point of failure

### Low Priority
1. **No audit logging** - Difficult to track security events (partially addressed by lockout system)
2. **No IP geolocation checks** - Can't detect unusual login locations

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Security Enhancements

### Immediate (Before Internet Exposure)
```bash
# Add session management
npm install express-session redis connect-redis
```

### Short Term
- Implement password strength requirements in signup form (backend validation exists)
- [x] Add account lockout after failed attempts (‚úÖ completed)
- Add audit logging for security events (partially implemented)
- Implement proper session management

### Long Term
- Two-factor authentication
- OAuth integration
- [x] Advanced threat detection (‚úÖ completed)
- Security penetration testing
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Geolocation-based access control

## üöÄ Safe Internet Exposure Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
1. HTTPS/TLS certificate installed
2. Strong JWT_SECRET configured
3. Production environment variables set
4. CORS properly configured for your domains
5. Rate limiting enabled (‚úÖ implemented)
6. Security headers enabled (‚úÖ implemented)
7. CSRF protection enabled (‚úÖ implemented)
8. Input validation enabled (‚úÖ implemented)
9. Account lockout mechanism (‚úÖ implemented)

### Recommended Before Public Exposure
1. [x] Account lockout mechanism (‚úÖ completed)
2. Audit logging system (partially implemented)
3. Monitoring and alerting setup

## üìù Security Testing

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test rate limiting with multiple requests
- [ ] Test authentication with invalid tokens
- [ ] Test CORS with unauthorized origins
- [ ] Test input validation with malicious payloads

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Security unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flows
- [ ] Penetration testing tools (OWASP ZAP, etc.)
