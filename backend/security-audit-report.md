- **Impact**: Sensitive information could leak into logs
- **Locations**: Found in `auth.ts`, `sqlClient.ts`, `tasks.ts`
- **Recommendation**: Replace with structured logging system

### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

#### 4. **Rate Limiting Configuration**
- **Finding**: General rate limiter set to 10,000 requests/15min (very high)
- **Impact**: Insufficient protection against abuse
- **Location**: `server.ts:69`
- **Recommendation**: Reduce to 1,000 requests/15min for production

#### 5. **Environment Variable Validation**
- **Finding**: JWT_SECRET validation only in production
- **Impact**: Weak secrets may be used in development/staging
- **Recommendation**: Validate all environments

#### 6. **Database Connection Security**
- **Finding**: No connection pooling limits configured
- **Impact**: Potential connection exhaustion attacks
- **Recommendation**: Configure Prisma connection limits

### 🟢 Low Priority Issues

#### 7. **CORS Configuration**
